# Documentation

To generate static documentation using docfx locally, follow these steps:

```
cd "path to the repository"
cd ./docs
docfx docfx.json
```

If you want to run a server to host the documentation, use the --serve flag with the docfx command:

```
cd "path to the repository"
cd ./docs
docfx docfx.json --serve
```

The documentation will be generated as a website in the docs/_site directory. The process is configured to copy the docs/api folder, generated by docfx when mapping the projects, into the site along with the artifacts inside the docs/ folder that allow for the inclusion of an index and a welcome page.
> [!NOTE] 
> Running docfx ./docs/docfx.json --serve from the root of the repository yields the same result locally.

To generate the image:

```
docker build -t <image name>:latest -f ./docs/Dockerfile .
```
