## Install

### Via NuGet Package Manager

To install the latest version of Cedeira.Essentials.NET via the NuGet Package Manager, run the following command in the NuGet Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Cedeira.Essentials.NET
```

### Via .NET CLI

To install the latest version using the .NET CLI, run this command:

```shell
dotnet add package Cedeira.Essentials.NET
```

Or, to install a specific version:

```shell
dotnet add package Cedeira.Essentials.NET --version X.X.X
```

&nbsp;

## Documentation

To generate static documentation using docfx locally, follow these steps:

```shell
cd "path to the repository"
cd ./docs
docfx docfx.json
```

If you want to run a server to host the documentation, use the --serve flag with the docfx command:

```shell
cd "path to the repository"
cd ./docs
docfx docfx.json --serve
```

The documentation will be generated as a website in the `docs/_site` directory. The process is configured to copy the `docs/api` folder, generated by `docfx` when mapping the projects, into the site along with the artifacts inside the `docs/` folder that allow for the inclusion of an index and a welcome page.

> [!NOTE]
> Running docfx ./docs/docfx.json --serve from the root of the repository yields the same result locally.

To generate the image:

```shell
docker build -t <image name>:latest -f ./docs/Dockerfile .
```
